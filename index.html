                <h2>Software Engineer. Photographer. Car Enthusiast.</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Nick, a passionate programmer, photographer, and car enthusiast. I enjoy capturing moments through my lens and embarking on long drives in my favorite cars. My current car garage
                    includes a 2024 Honda Civis SI, 2020 Toyota Supra, and a 2023 Toyota GR86. I have always been a huge fan of cars and enjoy rolling through the gears of my 6-speed manual transmission cars,
                    especially on some twisty roads! Aside from cars, my other passion lies with software development. I am a contributor on some open-source software and have a public github repository which 
                    showcases most of my software work. I also do a lot of freelance software development, so if you are ever in need of an application, let me know!
                </p>
                <p>For my photography, I shoot with a Canon EOS R with a Canon RF35mm F1.8 IS Macro STM Lens and a Canon RF 85mm F1.2 L USM Lens. I constantly juggle multiple projects, so make sure to visit often for updates!</p>
                <p>Here are some of my most notable current projects:</p>
