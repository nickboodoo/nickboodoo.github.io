                    <h2>AI Pirates</h2>
                    <p>I created this project because I wanted to learn more about what neural networks can do and how I can create/manipulate them. AI Pirates is a puzzle game featuring randomly 
                        generated mazes. The object of the game is for an artifical intelligence agent to be able to successfully traverse through the puzzles. I wrote this project in Jupyter Notebooks so that 
                        it would be lightweight and easy to run.

                    <h2>Flight Data App</h2>
                    <p>My main objective was to design and implement a project that would be evaluated well based on its visual design, website intuitiveness and code structure. 
                        I created a scalable website using JavaScript, HTML, CSS using ReactJS and NodeJS that will return data queried by the user. Specifically, 
                        the data in this case for the interview project will be flight data. The user will enter my website, type in their flight IATA number into the search bar, 
                        and flights relating to their flight number will be returned to them. I am really proud of this project because I accomplished a lot in the 3 hour time limit.

                    <p>I created this application as part of a final round interview for a company that creates geolocation libraries for JavaScript. I decided to make this application run 
                        on their competitor's api: openweather.api to prove that I can create applications from the ground up using open-source technologies.
                        This is a simple application that determines the time of day based on the user's current location.

                    <p>THRILL is a text-based navigation game developed in Python, where players aim to reach a designated "goal location" on a dynamically generated map. 
                        The game leverages a simple text-based interface and utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to offer hints on finding the shortest path to the goal.

                        The vector was then selection sorted. Through the main menu, the user could search for a particular course within
